I recently finished a course in Cybrary. I've learned how to create a program that use to work with nmap, key logger, and brute force programs. 

The program I have uploaded requires the following libraries/programs in order for you to maximize the use of the program.

* https://nmap.org/download.html (installed separately)
* python-nmap
* pynput
* zipfile
* argpase
* logging
* sys
* time

I did this program for educational purposes. I am not responsible for any havoc on your system if this is misused. Please be responsible. Thanks!
